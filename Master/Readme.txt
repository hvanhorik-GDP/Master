Student: Henry Van Horik
Student Number: 0966956
Course: INFO6019 - Physics and simulation
Project: MidTerm 2019

To build:
	Select Release/x64 target
	right click on project "Master" and hit build

 I have placed searches in the code so you can track down examples for what I am discussing

 Select Search: 
	 Enter the project code. "INFO6019"
	 Pulldown "Entire Solution"
	 Pulldown "Find All"
		- This will find all references to the code that is implmenting specific stuff

Keyboard commands:
Move the camera:

X / Shift - X		- Adjust camera in the +/- X position
Y / Shift - Y		- Adjust camera in the +/- Y position
Z / Shift - Z		- Adjust camera in the +/- Z position

L - Turn on/off Laser.

The same code will run all projects. They just need a different external script/xml file.
To change enter the following:
   Select "Master"
   Right-click/Properties
   Debugging
   Command Arguments
   Enter either "GraphicsLibrary.xml" 
   or "PhysicsLibrary.xml"

 This switches back and forth between the two projects.
